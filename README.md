My parents fled to the United States as children, escaping communism and the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1954 to 1975. As a second-generation Vietnamese American, I grew up with limited fluency in Vietnamese, even though my parents were fully bilingual. Having spent my whole life in California, I never felt the need to nurture my mother tongue. Looking back, I regret not staying closer to my culture and not learning what should have been my native language.

With OpenAI’s assistance, I receive a random word that can be used to positively describe someone or serve as a compliment. I’ve paired this with Bing’s Translate API to learn the Vietnamese translation of each word.

## Getting Started

First, add a .env file to the source root folder and include 
> OPENAI_API_KEY=

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
